Our lab focuses on the unique integration of image analysis techniques with computational mechanics and isogeometric analysis with applications such as  patient-specific modeling, computational neuroscience, and tissue engineering. We focus on developing generalized frameworks that can efficiently handle arbitrary image data to generate accurate computational models and provide analysis for complex applications.
